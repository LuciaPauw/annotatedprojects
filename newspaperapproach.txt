Follow the newspaper article approach when annotating, for example, the PDD of an existing anthropogenic impact project:
Who, where, when, how, why, what.
Who: an Agent
Where: a Location
When: a Period (projectPeriod, accountingPeriod, or creditingPeriod)
How: a Procedure, with Inputs, Outputs and Instruments specified
Why: an Objective (every Activity is guided by a Procedure, and every Procedure has an Objective.)
What: an Activity, with Objective (why), Agent (who), Procedure (how), Location (where), Period (when), and a description of the Activity/s specified.
